# Description of the Project
For my GE1 assignment I plan on creating a Game similar to an endless runner game. 
This Game will be in a procedurally generated Scene/Terrain e.g. a forest, mountains, desert, city. I plan to make this as visually stunning
as possible.

There will be two Procedurally generated levels, one will use a cube/obstacle spawner and the terrain will be generate using Perlin noise. the second level will use object pooling for its obstacles, and procedurally generate the terrain with a different method using a mesh generator.
