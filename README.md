Games engines 1 Assignment Jake Bolger C18395341  - Procedural Generation / Audio Visualizer

For my GE1 assignment I plan on creating an audio visualizer that responds to microphone input rather than the usual response to just music. 
This audio visualizer will be in a procedurally generated Scene/Terrain e.g. a forest, mountains, desert, city. I plan to make this as visually stunning
as possible.

Possibly change idea to a game instead of audio visualizer.
