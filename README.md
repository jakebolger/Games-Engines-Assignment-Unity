# Description of the Project
The goal for this project was to create a procedurally generated system in Unity. This System comprises of three different Scenes, a start Menu, a procedurally generated nature environemt and a mini game with a procedurally generated terrain as its background. The menu has three options to chose from, Explore, Mini Game, and Quit. The procedurally generated terains are red forest for bothe the exlpore option and the Mini Game. The Explore scene also has a beach with a generated Sea.

# Instructions for use
To use this project you must run the Start Menu scene in the Unity Editor, from there you can select and option from the Menu. When you select the Explore button, the game will bring you to the explore scene where you will be brought through a tour of the enviornment getting a look at the forrest and the beach.
Next, to access the Mini Game you will need to select the Mini Game button from the Main Menu. The game will bring you to the mini game where you can use the controls 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D', to move the marble player on the rotating panel. The aim of the game is to try and stay on the panel without gettin knocked off by the Enemy player or touching any of the red obstacles on the panel. If you fall off or touch the obstacles, the player will respawn where you started.
